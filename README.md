# DATS6101-P2-Movie-Revenue-Prediction
In this project we are building a Prediction Model to predict Revenue generated by a movie based on movie details.

## Detailed Problem Statement: 

The movie industry is a dynamic and complex environment where various factors influence a movie's success, particularly its revenue. This project focuses on developing a robust "Predictive Model for Movie Revenue Estimation and Decision Support." In an era of high uncertainty and financial risk in the film production business, understanding the determinants of movie revenue is paramount for informed decision-making, investment strategies, and marketing planning.

Movies are a unique combination of artistic expression and commercial ventures. To that end, this research investigates a multitude of features that contribute to the financial performance of a movie. These include aspects like genres, original languages, overview, popularity, production companies, release date, budget, runtime, status, tagline, vote average, vote count, credits, keywords, poster path, backdrop path, and recommendations. Each of these factors is scrutinized meticulously to unravel their individual and collective influence on movie revenue.

By conducting a comprehensive analysis of these features, this research aims to identify patterns, relationships, and correlations that can offer valuable insights into revenue prediction. The findings of this study are expected to have substantial implications for movie production companies, investors, and stakeholders. They can leverage the predictive model developed in this project to make informed decisions regarding their movie investments, marketing strategies, and financial planning, ultimately contributing to the success and profitability of their ventures in the film industry.

## Data Analysis and Findings :

Which feature is highly correlated with revenue?
Being a regression problem, what is the best metric to evaluate our model?
Which regression model gives out best results while prediction?
What is the root mean squared error, r2 and other metrics for predicting the revenue of a movie?
By using Statistical tests and models learned, we will try to predict the revenue of movie based on independent features.

Reference guide for the columns in the dataset:

title: Movie or show name
genres: Content categories or themes
original_language: Language of the original content
popularity: Measure of audience interest
release_date: Date of public availability
budget: Cost of production
revenue: Income generated from content
runtime: Duration of the content
status: Current release status
vote_average: Average audience ratings
vote_count: Number of audience votes 12.trailer_views: Number of trailer views
trailer_likes: Number of trailer likes
This lets us identify which features are significant.

From the glossary, we have these subjective columns which are hard to interpret and use in modelling. So we remove them. - id - overview - production_companies - tagline - credits - keywords - poster_path - backdrop_path - recommendations It is not a good idea to use these features as these are just metadata and do not tell anything about how well movie will perform. This is how our dataset looks now.

### Data Cleaning:
Inferences:

Budget of Movies are having value 0, which is not possible (Remove rows with budget 0)
Revenue has negative values which is again not possible (Remove rows with revenue 0 or negative)
Runtime of Movies are having value 0, which is not possible (Remove rows with runtime 0)
Check for outliers and influential points in all the columns.
Runtime had 0.004% missing values.
These values were dropped as number of missing value is small.
